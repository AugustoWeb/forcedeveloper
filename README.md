<h4> Hello Dev, I come here to share two login & registration pages, they are made in html and css only.<h4>
  <p>I'm creating a forum and I'm going to update this code recently, with new styles and new things that I'm going to address from html css who knows a little bit of js, ok let's go down here with some illustrations!</p>
  <p>All web pages are responsive and adapt to all devices</p>
  <p>Free to use but you can't post it on your profile saying you own it</p>
